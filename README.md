# Finite Power Integration Project

## Introduction
This project entailed the application of numerical integration methods to solve an oscillating energy system's power equation, with the goal of computing energy consumption over time.

## Approach
- **Integration Techniques**: Employed rectangle, midpoint, and trapezoidal rule methods to approximate the integral of the power function.
- **Error Analysis**: Calculated both absolute and relative errors to evaluate the precision of each numerical method against the analytical solution.

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy in energy computation, with the relative error percentages for each method analyzed and documented.

## Tools Used
- MATLAB for numerical computations and error analysis.
- Custom scripts for implementing integration techniques and calculating errors.

## Usage
The repository provides MATLAB code, alongside a comprehensive guide on running the simulations and interpreting the results.
